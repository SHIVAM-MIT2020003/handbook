Coding Tips:

1. Start with Brute-force
2. Pattern Detection
3. Time complexity to APPROACH
4. N-Dimensional Observation
5. Pre-Simplification
6. Naming Convention
7. Visualization => CODE (***)
8. Example => Observation (***)
9. Slow and Complete Visual Simulation
10. Simulation => Code (***)
11. Think ONLY LOGIC                            (DO NOT THINK ABOUT CODE)
12. NO Overthinking
